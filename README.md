### Hi there 👋

I'm a software developer who worked at Unity 2D game development for the last 2 years. However i have a huge interest about data analysis and data science. I have wanted to become a data scientist since college. I have been spending most of my time practicing in algorithms, data structures, Python artificial intelligence principles and Python libraries. So I ❤️ Python 😊😊😊
